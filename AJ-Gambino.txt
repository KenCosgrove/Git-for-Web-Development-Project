Stretch Questions (tomorrows training kit)

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    block elements start on a new line while inline will remain on the same line.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
absolute position removes that element from the document flow and positions it relative to its nearest parent element. if no ancestor, it would be positioned absolute to the body

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    display: inline-block;

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
   block- div, li, section
   inline- span, a
   inline-block- button

   5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

box model describes the design and layout of html elements in CSS. content is its own "box" while padding, border, and margin are boxes surrounding the content. padding gives space around the content without affecting other elements. border surrounds the padding, and margin is the spacing around all of it which changes the relative positioning to other elements.
im not sure what the fix is but im guessing it has something to do with either using %'s or vh/vw
